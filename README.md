# Metadata Extractor

Built a FastAPI-based NLP pipeline using spaCy to extract dates, authors, and key terms from unstructured PDF, DOCX, and TXT files via rule-based and NER methods.
Dockerized and deployed the service with scalable APIs, adding logging, validation, and testing for robust metadata extraction in research documents.
